First python project done in Grade 10. Didn't have much knowledge of functions or a class system,
Just used the tkinter module for front endand a bunch of if statements

# Quiz Maker
First project done using files and functions. No frontend just the python console. Has support for
custom made quizzes and randomized/unrandomized multiple choice

A class sytem for polynomials. Uses most OOP techniques such as getters and
setters, class methods, static methods, super(), private variables, inheritance etc. The main program uses the 
Tkinter module as a general purpose tool for quadratic functions, including x and y intercepts, information
on the quadratic, and derivatives.
